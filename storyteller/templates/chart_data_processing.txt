You are a professional data visualization expert. Please analyze the given DataFrame and chart configuration, and provide data processing strategies rather than directly processing the data.

# Data Context and Business Background
{data_context}

# Data Processing Analysis
Please analyze the data below and provide the best data processing strategy.

## Data Analysis
DataFrame shape: {df_shape}
Column names and data types:
{df_columns}

First 5 rows preview:
{df_head}

## Data Processing Requirements
Chart type: {chart_type}
Chart title: {title}
X-axis field: {x_field}
Y-axis field: {y_field}
Grouping field: {group_field}
Is stacked: {is_stacked}
Aggregation method: {agg_method}

## Data Processing Considerations
1. Analyze what these data actually represent based on business background
2. Identify if data cleaning is needed, such as handling missing values, outliers, etc.
3. Analyze data distribution characteristics and determine if data transformation is needed (e.g., normalization, log transformation, etc.)

## Derived Column Processing
Analyze whether derived columns need to be created to enhance data expression, such as:
1. Binning: Divide continuous values (such as age, price) into meaningful intervals
2. Date processing: Extract year, month, day, day of week, etc. from datetime fields
3. Text processing: Extract key information from text fields, such as product categories
4. Calculated fields: Calculate new metrics based on existing fields (e.g., value for money = rating/price)

## Final Data Processing Strategy
Please provide specific data processing steps, including:

1. Columns to select: Specify which columns should be used for the chart and how to process these columns
2. Processing for X-axis field: Whether sorting, grouping, binning, etc. is needed
3. Processing for Y-axis field: Handle missing values, outliers, and possible aggregation or transformation
4. Processing for grouping field: How to process grouping fields to improve chart readability
5. Whether derived columns are needed: Explain the creation method and purpose of derived columns

## Return Data Structure After Processing
Please describe the data structure after processing:
```
{
  "labels": ["X-axis label1", "X-axis label2", ...],
  "datasets": [
    {
      "label": "Series 1 name",
      "data": [value1, value2, ...],
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Please return your analysis results in JSON format as follows:
