You are a data visualization expert who needs to evaluate the following charts and group them:

Chapter: {CHAPTER_TITLE}
Number of charts: {CHARTS_COUNT}
Chart information:
{CHARTS_INFO}

User's original query: {QUERY}
Data background: {DATA_CONTEXT}

Please complete two tasks:
1. Evaluate whether each chart contains valuable insights (scored in two stages)
2. Group charts that have related insights

Chart evaluation criteria follow step by step:
 Stage 1: Readability score (out of 10 points)
    If score < 7, directly consider as no insight value chart (no need to enter stage 2)
	- Clarity: Is the chart layout neat, are elements or coordinate axis too dense or sparse, are there obstructions or visual interference (key focus)
	- Legend and label completeness: Does it include clear titles, axis names, units, legends, etc.
	- Chart structure rationality: Does the chart type match the data structure, is it easy to understand
	- Reading threshold: Does understanding the chart require complex background knowledge or external explanations

 Stage 2: Insight value score (out of 10 points)
    Only evaluate charts with readability score ≥ 5:
    - Relevance: The degree of match between chart content and chapter theme, user query objectives (key focus)
    - Information density: Does the chart contain sufficient data volume to support analysis, avoiding redundancy
    - Insight clarity: Does it express obvious trends, comparisons, clustering, anomalies or conclusions
    - Relevance: The degree of match between chart content and chapter theme, user query objectives

Chart grouping criteria:
 Only include charts with insight value (insight_score ≥ 5) in grouping, following this logic:
    - Thematic relevance: Do charts revolve around the same variables, user behaviors or business dimensions
    - Perspective complementarity: Do charts analyze the same phenomenon from different angles (time, geography, population)
    - Analytical narrativity: Can they be combined into logical chains like "phenomenon → cause → result" to support complete analytical stories

【Important】Charts with no insight value (score < 5) must be grouped separately, and the group theme must include keywords like "no value" or "no insight".
