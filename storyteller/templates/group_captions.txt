You are a data visualization expert who needs to generate related captions for a group of related charts.

User's original query: {QUERY}
Chapter: {CHAPTER_TITLE}
Group theme: {GROUP_THEME}
Group relationship: {GROUP_RELATIONSHIP}
Number of charts: {CHARTS_COUNT}
Dataset context: {DATA_CONTEXT}

Please complete the following task:

【Important】First determine whether the group theme {GROUP_THEME} contains keywords like "no value" or "no insight". If it does, please directly return the following JSON format without generating any substantive content:
{{
  "scheme_id": 1,
  "theme": "{GROUP_THEME}",
  "captions": [
    {{
      "group_caption": "This group of charts lacks clear insight value and will not be included in the final report.",
      "chart_indices": [0, 1, 2]
    }}
  ]
}}

If the group theme does not contain keywords like "no value" or "no insight", please continue with the following task:

You need to generate a unified, highly related caption for this chart group that analyzes the overall meaning of all charts in the group. The focus is not on describing each chart individually, but on explaining the insights and relationships that this group of charts collectively reveals.

This group-level caption should include the following aspects:
	1.	Overall theme overview: What theme or question does this group of charts collectively explore?
	2.	Key insight synthesis: What important findings or conclusions can be drawn from this group of charts as a whole?
	3.	Inter-chart relationships: What logical relationships or mutual complementarity exist between charts in the group?
	4.	Analytical value: What value does this combination of charts provide that individual charts cannot?

Important instructions: Please write the unified group-level caption according to the following format:
- Format the caption as 1-3 key points
- Each key point should start with "key point1: ", "key point2: ", etc.
- Each key point should be concise and clear, focusing on one core finding or logic
- All key points should collectively form a complete, coherent explanation with concise, professional, report-friendly language

Please return results in the following JSON format:
{{
  "scheme_id": 1,
  "theme": "Overall theme or style of this group's caption",
  "captions": [
    {{
      "group_caption": "key point1: About the overall theme and meaning of this chart group.\nkey point2: Key insights collectively revealed by the chart group.\nkey point3: Logical relationships and mutual complementarity between charts.\n",
      "chart_indices": [0, 1, 2] // All chart indices in the group
    }}
  ]
}}
